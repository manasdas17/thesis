  abstract = {The problem of recovering a sparse signal x Rn from a relatively small
	number of its observations of the form y = Ax Rk, where A is a known
	matrix and k « n, has recently received a lot of attention under
	the rubric of compressed sensing ({CS}) and has applications in many
	areas of signal processing such as data cmpression, image processing,
	dimensionality reduction, etc. Recent work has established that if
	A is a random matrix with entries drawn independently from certain
	probability distributions then exact recovery of x from these observations
	can be guaranteed with high probability. In this paper, we show that
	Toeplitz-structured matrices with entries drawn independently from
	the same distributions are also sufficient to recover x from y with
	high probability, and we compare the performance of such matrices
	with that of fully independent and identically distributed ones.
	The use of Toeplitz matrices in {CS} applications has several potential
	advantages: (i) they require the generation of only O(n) independent
	random variables; (ii) multiplication with Toeplitz matrices can
	be efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transform, resulting
	in faster acquisition and reconstruction algorithms; and (iii) Toeplitz-structured
	matrices arise naturally in certain application areas such as system
	identification.},

  abstract = {Coherent data communication over doubly-selective channels requires
	that the channel response be known at the receiver. Training-based
	schemes, which involve probing of the channel with known signaling
	waveforms and processing of the corresponding channel output to estimate
	the channel parameters, are commonly employed to learn the channel
	response in practice. Conventional training-based methods, often
	comprising of linear least squares channel estimators, are known
	to be optimal under the assumption of rich multipath channels. Numerous
	measurement campaigns have shown, however, that physical multipath
	channels tend to exhibit a sparse structure at high signal space
	dimension (time-bandwidth product), and can be characterized with
	significantly fewer parameters compared to the maximum number dictated
	by the delay-Doppler spread of the channel. In this paper, it is
	established that traditional training-based channel learning techniques
	are ill-suited to fully exploiting the inherent low-dimensionality
	of sparse channels. In contrast, key ideas from the emerging theory
	of compressed sensing are leveraged to propose sparse channel learning
	methods for both single-carrier and multicarrier probing waveforms
	that employ reconstruction algorithms based on convex/linear programming.
	In particular, it is shown that the performance of the proposed schemes
	come within a logarithmic factor of that of an ideal channel estimator,
	leading to significant reductions in the training energy and the
	loss in spectral efficiency associated with conventional training-based
	methods.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a general framework for solving a variety of convex
	cone problems that frequently arise in signal processing, machine
	learning, statistics, and other fields. The approach works as follows:
	first, determine a conic formulation of the problem; second, determine
	its dual; third, apply smoothing; and fourth, solve using an optimal
	first-order method. A merit of this approach is its flexibility:
	for example, all compressed sensing problems can be solved via this
	approach. These include models with objective functionals such as
	the total-variation norm, {\textbar}{\textbar}Wx{\textbar}{\textbar}1
	where W is arbitrary, or a combination thereof. In addition, the
	paper introduces a number of technical contributions such as a novel
	continuation scheme and a novel approach for controlling the step
	size, and applies results showing that the smooth and unsmoothed
	problems are sometimes formally equivalent. Combined with our framework,
	these lead to novel, stable and computationally efficient algorithms.
	For instance, our general implementation is competitive with state-of-the-art
	methods for solving intensively studied problems such as the {LASSO}.
	Further, numerical experiments show that one can solve the Dantzig
	selector problem, for which no efficient large-scale solvers exist,
	in a few hundred iterations. Finally, the paper is accompanied with
	a software release. This software is not a single, monolithic solver;
	rather, it is a suite of programs and routines designed to serve
	as building blocks for constructing complete algorithms.},

  abstract = {Many problems of recent interest in statistics and machine learning
	can be posed in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the
	explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly
	important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of
	features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized
	collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed
	solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable.
	In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of
	multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and
	in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine
	learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s,
	with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to
	many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of
	multipliers, Douglas–Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial
	inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms
	for ℓ1 problems, proximal methods, and others. After briefly surveying
	the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications
	to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of
	recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression,
	basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and
	many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions
	to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including
	some details on distributed {MPI} and Hadoop {MapReduce} implementations.},

	epsi in the Euclidean (lscr2) metric? This paper shows that if the

	then it is possible to reconstruct f to within very high accuracy
	from a small number of random measurements by solving a simple linear

  abstract = {As an inner magnetospheric phenomenon the plasmapause region is of
	interest for a number of reasons, one being the occurrence there
	of geophysically important interactions between the plasmas of the
	hot plasma sheet and of the cool plasmasphere. There is a need for
	a conceptual framework within which to examine and discuss these
	interactions and their consequences, and we therefore suggest that
	the plasmapause region be called the Plasmasphere Boundary Layer,
	or {PBL}. Such a term has been slow to emerge because of the complexity
	and variability of the plasma populations that can exist near the
	plasmapause and because of the variety of criteria used to identify
	the plasmapause in experimental data. Furthermore, and quite importantly
	in our view, a substantial obstacle to the consideration of the plasmapause
	region as a boundary layer has been the longstanding tendency of
	textbooks on space physics to limit introductory material on the
	plasmapause phenomenon to zeroth order descriptions in terms of ideal
	{MHD} theory, thus implying that the plasmasphere is relatively well
	understood. A textbook may introduce the concept of shielding of
	the inner magnetosphere from perturbing convection electric fields,
	but attention is not usually paid to the variety of physical processes
	reported to occur in the {PBL}, such as heating, instabilities, and
	fast longitudinal flows, processes which must play roles in plasmasphere
	dynamics in concert with the flow regimes associated with the major
	dynamo sources of electric fields. We believe that through the use
	of the {PBL} concept in future textbook discussions of the plasmasphere
	and in scientific communications, much progress can be made on longstanding
	questions about the physics involved in the formation of the plasmapause

	Until now, most of the meteor-head echo studies have been performed

	approach using a defocusing scheme, similar to Chirp (linear frequency

	in the N beam, (2) we detected 10 times more large cross-section
	(strong) meteors ( \&gt; 15 {dB} if they were measured by the N mainlobe)

	meteors were observed in the N sidelobes, therefore being at least
	20 {dB} stronger if they were observed in the N mainlobe. Our results
	are summarized in a corrected distribution of relative meteor cross-sections

	their {SNR} values depending on where in the beam they were detected
	(sidelobes or mainlobe). In addition, we show a qualitative meteor
	cross-section distribution that one can obtain combining W and N
	beams. The resulting distribution is incomplete, since the W beam
	is not sensitive enough to detect the very small (weak) meteors,

  abstract = {High-power, large-aperture ({HPLA}) radars detect the plasma that
	forms in the vicinity of a meteoroid and moves approximately at its
	velocity; reflections from these plasmas are called head echoes.
	For over a decade, {HPLA} radars have been detecting head echoes
	with peak velocity distributions \&gt;50 km/s. These results have
	created some controversy within the field of meteor physics because
	previous data, including spacecraft impact cratering studies, optical
	and specular meteor data, indicate that the peak of the velocity
	distribution to a set limiting mass should be \&lt;20 km/s [Love,
	S.G., Brownlee, D.E., 1993. Science 262, 550–553]. Thus the question
	of whether {HPLA} radars are preferentially detecting high-velocity
	meteors arises. In this paper we attempt to address this question
	by examining both modeled and measured head echo data using the {ALTAIR}
	radar, collected during the Leonid 1998 and 1999 showers. These data
	comprise meteors originating primarily from the North Apex sporadic
	meteor source. First, we use our scattering theory to convert measured
	radar-cross-section ({RCS}) to electron line density and mass, as
	well as to convert modeled electron line density and mass to {RCS}.
	We subsequently compare the dependence between mass, velocity, mean-free-path,
	{RCS} and line density using both the measured and modeled data by
	performing a multiple, linear regression fit. We find a strong correlation
	between derived mass and velocity and show that line density is approximately
	proportional to mass times velocity3.1. Next, we determine the cumulative
	mass index using subsets of our data and use this mass index, along
	with the results of our regression fit, to weight the velocity distribution.
	Our results show that while there does indeed exist a bias in the
	measured head echo velocity distribution, it is smaller than those
	calculated using traditional specular trail data due to the different
	scattering mechanism, and also includes a bias against the low-mass,
	very high-velocity meteoroids.},

	on 17 November 1998, was observed using radar and optical sensors
	at the Kwajalein Missile Range in order to study potential threats
	to orbiting spacecraft. Meteor head echo data were collected during
	the predicted peak of the “storm” primarily using the Advanced Research
	Projects Agency Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar ({ALTAIR}).
	{ALTAIR} is a dual-frequency radar at {VHF} (160 {MHz}) and {UHF}
	(422 {MHz}) that is uniquely suited for detecting meteor head echoes
	due to high sensitivity, precise calibration, and the ability to
	record radar data at a high rate (Gb/min). {ALTAIR} transmits right-circular
	({RC}) polarized energy and records left-circular ({LC}) sum, {RC}
	sum, {LC} azimuth angle difference, and {LC} elevation angle difference
	channels; these four measurements facilitate the determination of
	three-dimensional target position and velocity as a function of radar
	cross section and time. During the predicted peak of the storm, {ALTAIR}
	detected 734 {VHF} head echoes in 29 min of data and 472 {UHF} head
	echoes in 17 min of data, as well as numerous specular and nonspecular
	ionization trails. This paper contains analysis on the head echo
	data, including dual-frequency statistics and the variability of

  abstract = {A head echo is the radar reflection from the plasma immediately surrounding
	a meteoroid upon its entry into the Earth's atmosphere; analysis
	of these plasmas can help determine a parent meteoroid's inherent
	properties, such as mass. In the past, meteoroid mass was calculated
	using head echo velocity and deceleration data by assuming momentum
	conservation between the meteoroid and air molecule. We refer to
	such masses as “dynamical masses.” This method, however, can only
	be used to determine meteoroid mass if either the meteoroid radius
	or density is assumed. In this paper, we expound upon a new method
	for determining a meteoroid's mass by utilizing our new spherical
	scattering theory. This theory allows us to use head echo measurements
	to calculate head echo plasma density. Then, by using the plasma
	density in an established formula that estimates the ratio of unionized
	to ionized material produced by an ablating meteoroid, we can determine
	a meteoroid's mass. We refer to such masses as “scattering masses.”
	We show that our new mass determination method applies to head echoes
	detected simultaneously at {VHF} and {UHF} and verify that the meteoroid
	mass is the same at both frequencies. We conclude with a comparison
	between dynamical and scattering masses and show that in general,
	these methods agree to within an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Meteor data collected at the Kwajalein Missile Range ({KMR}) during
	the peak of the 1998 Leonid storm comprise the only simultaneous
	observations of meteor head echoes and trails using seven frequencies
	(very high frequency ({VHF}), ultrahigh frequency ({UHF}), L-, S-,
	C-, Ka-, and W-band spanning 160 {MHz} to 95 {GHz}). The primary
	sensor was the {ARPA} Long-Range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar
	({ALTAIR}) radar operating at 160 {MHz} with 30 m range resolution
	and 422 {MHz} with 7.5 m range resolution, including both interferometric
	and polarization capabilities. This paper presents an analysis of
	this high-resolution data set with the following results: First,
	these observations support the theory that head echo scattering arises
	from an ionized region with a density sufficiently high that its
	plasma frequency exceeds the radar frequency (overdense reflection).
	Second, radar cross section ({RCS}) decreases rapidly with decreasing
	wavelength because higher frequencies must penetrate further into
	the increasing density of the plasma surrounding the meteoroid to
	reach its reflection point. Third, head echo angle measurements indicate
	that most of the observed meteors are sporadics not originating from
	the Leonid radiant. Fourth, polarization ratios showed that head
	echo reflections result from plasmas with a circular cross section.
	Fifth, the highest {RCS} values are detected near 105 km altitude,
	where the meteoroid gives up the most kinetic energy during its decent.
	This paper presents the first analyses of a three-frequency head
	echo as well as the polarization ratios and {RCS} characteristics
	from numerous two-frequency head echoes, which will allow us to develop
	a better understanding of meteor physics.},

  abstract = {We present an improved technique for calculating bulk densities of
	low-mass (\&lt;1 g) meteoroids using a scattering model applied to
	the high-density plasma formed around the meteoroid as it enters
	Earth’s atmosphere. These plasmas, referred to as head echoes, travel
	at or near the speed of the meteoroid, thereby allowing the determination
	of the ballistic coefficient (mass divided by physical cross-section),
	which depends upon speed and deceleration. Concurrently, we apply
	a scattering model to the returned signal strength of the head echo
	in order to correlate radar-cross-section ({RCS}) to plasma density
	and meteoroid mass. In this way, we can uniquely solve for the meteoroid
	mass, radius and bulk density independently. We have applied this
	new technique to head echo data collected in 2007 and 2008 simultaneously
	at {VHF} (160 {MHz}) and {UHF} (422 {MHz}) at {ALTAIR}, which is
	a high-power large-aperture radar located on the Kwajalein Atoll.
	These data include approximately 20,000 detections with dual-frequency,
	dual-polarization, and monopulse (i.e. angle) returns. From 2000
	detections with the smallest monopulse errors, we find a mean meteoroid
	bulk density of 0.9 g/cm3 with observations spanning almost three
	orders of magnitude from 0.01 g/cm3 to 8 g/cm3. Our results show
	a clear dependence between meteoroid bulk density and altitude of
	head echo formation, as well as dependence between meteoroid bulk
	density and 3D speed. The highest bulk densities are detected at
	the lowest altitudes and lowest speeds. Additionally, we stipulate
	that the approximations used to derive the ballistic parameter, in
	addition to neglecting fragmentation, suggest that the traditional
	ballistic parameter must be used with caution when determining meteoroid
	parameters.},

	we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct.
	If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known
	transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined
	here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than
	the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels
	need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful
	recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically,
	suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g.,
	wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients
	belong to an lscrp ball for 0{\textless}ples1. The N most important

	a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted

  abstract = {Compressed sensing posits that, within limits, one can undersample
	a sparse signal and yet reconstruct it accurately. Knowing the precise
	limits to such undersampling is important both for theory and practice.
	We present a formula that characterizes the allowed undersampling
	of generalized sparse objects. The formula applies to approximate
	message passing ({AMP}) algorithms for compressed sensing, which
	are here generalized to employ denoising operators besides the traditional
	scalar soft thresholding denoiser. This paper gives several examples
	including scalar denoisers not derived from convex penalization-the
	firm shrinkage nonlinearity and the minimax nonlinearity-and also
	nonscalar denoisers-block thresholding, monotone regression, and
	total variation minimization. Let the variables ε = k/N and δ = n/N
	denote the generalized sparsity and undersampling fractions for sampling
	the k-generalized-sparse N-vector x0 according to y=Ax0. Here, A
	is an n×N measurement matrix whose entries are iid standard Gaussian.
	The formula states that the phase transition curve δ = δ(ε) separating
	successful from unsuccessful reconstruction of x0 by {AMP} is given
	by δ = M(ε{\textbar}Denoiser) where M(ε{\textbar}Denoiser) denotes
	the per-coordinate minimax mean squared error ({MSE}) of the specified,
	optimally tuned denoiser in the directly observed problem y = x +
	z. In short, the phase transition of a noiseless undersampling problem
	is identical to the minimax {MSE} in a denoising problem. We prove
	that this formula follows from state evolution and present numerical
	results validating it in a wide range of settings. The above formula
	generates numerous new insights, both in the scalar and in the nonscalar
	cases.},

  abstract = {Consider the noisy underdetermined system of linear equations: y =
	Ax0 + z, with A an n × N measurement matrix, n {\textless}; N, and
	z {\textasciitilde} N(0, σ2I) a Gaussian white noise. Both y and
	A are known, both x0 and z are unknown, and we seek an approximation
	to x0. When x0 has few nonzeros, useful approximations are often
	obtained by ℓ1-penalized ℓ2 minimization, in which the reconstruction
	x̂1,λ solves min\{{\textbar}{\textbar}y - Ax{\textbar}{\textbar}22/2
	+ λ{\textbar}{\textbar}x{\textbar}{\textbar}1\}. Consider the reconstruction
	mean-squared error {MSE} = E{\textbar}{\textbar} x̂1,λ - x0{\textbar}{\textbar}22/N,
	and define the ratio {MSE}/σ2 as the noise sensitivity. Consider
	matrices A with i.i.d. Gaussian entries and a large-system limit
	in which n, N → ∞ with n/N → δ and k/n → ρ. We develop exact expressions
	for the asymptotic {MSE} of x̂1,λ , and evaluate its worst-case noise
	sensitivity over all types of k-sparse signals. The phase space 0
	≤ 8, ρ ≤ 1 is partitioned by the curve ρ = ρ{MSE}(δ) into two regions.
	Formal noise sensitivity is bounded throughout the region ρ = ρ{MSE}(δ)
	and is unbounded throughout the region ρ = ρ{MSE}(δ). The phase boundary
	ρ = ρ{MSE}(δ) is identical to the previously known phase transition
	curve for equivalence of ℓ1 - ℓ0 minimization in the k-sparse noiseless
	case. Hence, a single phase boundary describes the fundamental phase
	transitions both for the noise less and noisy cases. Extensive computational
	experiments validate these predictions, including the existence of
	game-theoretical structures underlying it (saddlepoints in the payoff,
	- - least-favorable signals and maximin penalization). Underlying
	our formalism is an approximate message passing soft thresholding
	algorithm ({AMP}) introduced earlier by the authors. Other papers
	by the authors detail expressions for the formal {MSE} of {AMP} and
	its close connection to ℓ1-penalized reconstruction. The focus of
	the present paper is on computing the minimax formal {MSE} within
	the class of sparse signals x0.},

	yet accurately reconstruct them by exploiting signal characteristics.
	Accurate reconstruction is possible when the object to be recovered
	is sufficiently sparse in a known basis. Currently, the best known
	sparsity–undersampling tradeoff is achieved when reconstructing by
	convex optimization, which is expensive in important large-scale
	applications. Fast iterative thresholding algorithms have been intensively
	studied as alternatives to convex optimization for large-scale problems.
	Unfortunately known fast algorithms offer substantially worse sparsity–undersampling
	tradeoffs than convex optimization. We introduce a simple costless
	modification to iterative thresholding making the sparsity–undersampling
	tradeoff of the new algorithms equivalent to that of the corresponding
	convex optimization procedures. The new iterative-thresholding algorithms
	are inspired by belief propagation in graphical models. Our empirical
	measurements of the sparsity–undersampling tradeoff for the new algorithms
	agree with theoretical calculations. We show that a state evolution
	formalism correctly derives the true sparsity–undersampling tradeoff.
	There is a surprising agreement between earlier calculations based
	on random convex polytopes and this apparently very different theoretical
	formalism.},

  abstract = {We review connections between phase transitions in high-dimensional
	combinatorial geometry and phase transitions occurring in modern
	high-dimensional data analysis and signal processing. In data analysis,
	such transitions arise as abrupt breakdown of linear model selection,
	robust data fitting or compressed sensing reconstructions, when the
	complexity of the model or the number of outliers increases beyond
	a threshold. In combinatorial geometry, these transitions appear
	as abrupt changes in the properties of face counts of convex polytopes
	when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in these very different
	problems appear in the same critical locations after appropriate
	calibration of variables. These thresholds are important in each
	subject area: for linear modelling, they place hard limits on the
	degree to which the now ubiquitous high-throughput data analysis
	can be successful; for robustness, they place hard limits on the
	degree to which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate outliers
	before breaking down; for compressed sensing, they define the sharp
	boundary of the undersampling/sparsity trade-off curve in undersampling
	theorems. Existing derivations of phase transitions in combinatorial
	geometry assume that the underlying matrices have independent and
	identically distributed Gaussian elements. In applications, however,
	it often seems that Gaussianity is not required. We conducted an
	extensive computational experiment and formal inferential analysis
	to test the hypothesis that these phase transitions are universal
	across a range of underlying matrix ensembles. We ran millions of
	linear programs using random matrices spanning several matrix ensembles
	and problem sizes; visually, the empirical phase transitions do not
	depend on the ensemble, and they agree extremely well with the asymptotic
	theory assuming Gaussianity. Careful statistical analysis reveals
	discrepancies that can be explained as transient terms, decaying
	with problem size. The experimental results are thus consistent with
	an asymptotic large-n universality across matrix ensembles; finite-sample
	universality can be rejected.},

	of meteor velocities. While several radar methods exist for measuring
	meteor velocity, they may be biased by plasma reflection mechanisms.
	This paper presents a new method for deriving meteoroid velocity
	from the altitudinal extent of non-specular trails. This method employs
	our recent discoveries on meteor trail plasma instability. Dyrud
	et al. (2002) demonstrated that meteor trails are unstable over a
	limited altitude range, and that the precise altitudes of instability
	are dependent on the meteoroid that generated the trail. Since meteor
	trail instability results in field aligned irregularities ({FAI})
	that allow for radar reflection, non-specular trail observations
	may be used to derive velocity. We use {ALTAIR} radar data of combined
	head echos and non-specular trails to test non-specular trail derived
	velocity against head echo velocities. Meteor velocities derived
	from non-specular trail altitudinal width match to within 5 km/s
	when compared with head echo range rates from the same meteor. We
	apply this technique to Piura radar observations of hundreds of non-specular
	trails to produce histograms of occurrence of meteor velocity based
	solely on this non-specular trails width criterion. The results from
	this study show that the most probable velocity of meteors seen by
	the Piura radar is near 50 km/s, which is comparable with modern
	head echo studies.},

  abstract = {Recently, meteor head echo detections from high powered large aperture
	radars ({HPLA}) have brought new measurements to bear on the study
	of sporadic interplanetary meteors. These same observations have
	demonstrated an ability to observe smaller meteoroids without some
	of the geometrical restrictions of specular radar techniques. Yet
	incorporating data from various radar reflection types and from different
	radars into a single consistent model has proven challenging. We
	believe this arises due to poorly understood radio scattering characteristics
	of the meteor plasma, especially in light of recent work showing
	that plasma turbulence and instability greatly influences meteor
	trail properties at every stage of evolution. In order to overcome
	some of the unknown relationships between meteoroid characteristics
	(such as mass and velocity) and the resulting head echo radar cross-sections
	({RCS}), we present our results on meteor plasma simulations of head
	echo plasmas using particle in cell ({PIC}) ions, which show that
	electric fields strongly influence early stage meteor plasma evolution,
	by accelerating ions away from the meteoroid body at speeds as large
	as several kilometers per second. We also present the results of
	finite difference time domain electromagnetic simulations ({FDTD}),
	which can calculate the radar cross-section of the simulated meteor
	plasma electron distributions. These simulations have shown that
	the radar cross-section depends in a complex manner on a number of
	parameters. In this paper we demonstrate that for a given head echo
	plasma the {RCS} as a function of radar frequency peaks at sqrt (2*peak
	plasma frequency) and then decays linearly on a {dB} scale with increasing
	radar frequency. We also demonstrate that for a fixed radar frequency,
	the {RCS} increases linearly on a {dB} scale with increasing head
	echo plasma frequency. These simulations and resulting characterization
	of the head echo radar cross-section will both help relate {HPLA}
	radar observations to meteoroid properties and aid in determining

  abstract = {Compressive sensing ({CS}) techniques offer a framework for the detection
	and allocation of sparse signals with a reduced number of samples.
	Today, modern radar systems operate with high bandwidths—demanding
	high sample rates according to the Shannon–Nyquist theorem—and a
	huge number of single elements for phased array antennas. Often only
	a small amount of target parameters is the final output, arising
	the question, if {CS} could not be a good mean to reduce data size,
	complexity, weight, power consumption and costs of radar systems.
	There is only a small number of publications addressing the application
	of {CS} to radar, leaving several open questions. This paper addresses
	some aspects as a further step to {CS}-radar by presenting generic
	system architectures and implementation considerations. It is not
	the aim of this paper to investigate numerically efficient algorithms
	but to point to promising applications as well as arising problems.
	
	Three possible applications are considered: pulse compression, radar

  abstract = {Radio-echo observations of sporadic meteors at 68 cm are described.
	Sufficient information was gathered to permit the computation of
	the velocity, height, duration, and intensity for most of the meteors.
	The principal conclusions reached are that (a) the meteors recorded
	at this short wavelength are seen over a height range not sensibly
	different from that at long wavelengths; (b) the effective scattering
	lengths of the trails are short (∼50 meters); (c) the over-all lengths
	of the trails average 6 to 7 km; and (d). evidence of fragmentation
	is found in about 50\% of the meteors observed. The visual magnitude
	of these meteors, estimated from their rate, corresponds to +8. The
	short effective scattering length is attributed to a rapid initial
	expansion of the trail diameter. Five nighttime meteor showers were
	also studied. By continuously directing the antenna beam at right
	angles to their paths a very high ratio of shower to sporadic meteors
	could be obtained. The velocities of the five streams have been measured
	and also their mean over-all trail lengths. The mass laws obtained
	for the shower meteors indicated many more bright members than in
	the sporadic background but are believed to be inaccurate owing to
	the effects of fragmentation raising the echo intensity above that
	expected for a solid particle.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Despite the rapid decline in sequencing costs, sequencing
	large cohorts of individuals is still prohibitively expensive. Recently,
	several sophisticated pooling designs were suggested that can identify
	carriers of rare alleles in large cohorts with a significantly smaller
	number of pools, thus dramatically reducing the cost of such large-scale
	sequencing projects. These approaches use combinatorial pooling designs
	where each individual is either present or absent from a pool. One
	can then infer the number of carriers in a pool, and by combining
	information across pools, reconstruct the identity of the carriers.
	Results: We show that one can gain further efficiency and cost reduction
	by using ‘weighted’ designs, in which different individuals donate
	different amounts of {DNA} to the pools. Intuitively, in this situation,
	the number of mutant reads in a pool does not only indicate the number
	of carriers, but also their identity. We describe and study a powerful
	example of such weighted designs, using non-overlapping pools. We
	demonstrate that this approach is not only easier to implement and
	analyze but is also competitive in terms of accuracy with combinatorial
	designs when identifying rare variants, and is superior when sequencing
	common variants. We then discuss how weighting can be incorporated
	into existing combinatorial designs to increase their accuracy and
	demonstrate the resulting improvement using simulations. Finally,
	we argue that weighted designs have enough power to facilitate detection
	of common alleles, so they can be used as a cornerstone of whole-exome
	sequencing projects. Contact: saharon\{at\}post.tau.ac.il},

	a focus on variability resulting from meteorological forcing. The
	data are obtained by the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar
	(42.6°N, 288.5°E) on 18–31 January 2010, in coincidence with a major
	sudden stratospheric warming. We elucidate oscillations in ion temperature
	with both tidal periods ( 8 h and 12 h) and non-tidal periods ({\textgreater}24
	h) by analyzing residuals between the observed temperatures and those
	expected from an empirical model. We present the spatial-temporal
	development of periodicities in ion temperature and discuss to what
	degree these periodicities might be related to the sudden stratospheric
	warming event. The spectral location and temporal evolution of periodicities
	with 9.9–12.9 h and 6.2–7.9 h suggest that they are related to the
	semidiurnal (12 h) and terdiurnal (8 h) tides that are enhanced during
	the sudden stratospheric warming. Periodicities with 3–4 d and 10–13
	d are likely related to Rossby waves with 4 d and 10 d periods, while
	the strong periodicity observed at 16–17 h could result from the
	nonlinear interaction of the quasi 2 d wave with the semidiurnal
	tide. As planetary waves are not expected to propagate to altitudes
	of 200–250 km, these experimental results raise questions about the

  abstract = {During the thermalization process a meteor train expands very rapidly
	to an initial distribution, the extent of which one would expect,
	on general grounds, to scale as the inverse of the atmospheric density.
	Experimental determinations of the `initial radius' r\_i, however,
	show a much weaker dependence with height than this implies. In a
	re-examination of the initial radius problem we have followed earlier
	workers in modelling the initial expansion by assuming the meteoric
	particles (ions or atoms) and atmospheric atoms to be elastic spheres.
	We have obtained an analytic result for r\_i, exact within the framework
	of the model, as the rms value of the radial positions of the particles.
	However, this value is sufficient to calculate the radar echo amplitude
	only if the profile is known to be Gaussian. To obtain more detailed
	results, therefore, we have simulated the expansion process in a
	computer calculation of the motion of 10000 particles. The exact
	result for the rms value is important in enabling us to check the
	accuracy of this simulation. The calculation shows that the initial
	distribution is not Gaussian but has a core, with effective line
	density of the order of one-tenth of the total initial line density,
	and radius of the order of 0.4r\_i, immersed in a more diffuse distribution.
	Experimental determinations of the initial radius have been based
	upon the assumption of a Gaussian initial distribution but, more
	generally, the experiments provide values of ratios of Fourier components
	of the ionization profile, and when the simulation is compared with
	experiment on this basis satisfactory agreement is obtained. As the
	time development of the train from its initial distribution is usually
	treated by assuming a Gaussian profile we have added a discussion
	of the diffusion process applicable to general initial distributions.},

  abstract = {Space weather including solar activity and background plasma sets
	up spacecraft conditions that can magnify the threat from hypervelocity
	impacts. Hypervelocity impactors include both meteoroids, traveling
	between 11 and 72 km/s, and orbital debris, with typical impact speeds
	of 10 km/s. When an impactor encounters a spacecraft, its kinetic
	energy is converted over a very short timescale into energy of vaporization
	and ionization, resulting in a small, dense plasma. This plasma can
	produce radio frequency ({RF}) emission, causing electrical anomalies
	within the spacecraft. In order to study this phenomenon, we conducted
	ground-based experiments to study hypervelocity impact plasmas using
	a Van de Graaff dust accelerator. Iron projectiles ranging from 10−16
	g to 10−11 g were fired at speeds of up to 70 km/s into a variety
	of target materials under a range of surface charging conditions
	representative of space weather effects. Impact plasmas associated
	with bare metal targets as well as spacecraft materials were studied.
	Plasma expansion models were developed to determine the composition
	and temperature of the impact plasma, shedding light on the plasma
	dynamics that can lead to spacecraft electrical anomalies. The dependence
	of these plasma properties on target material, impact speed, and
	surface charge was analyzed. Our work includes three major results.
	First, the initial temperature of the impact plasma is at least an
	order of magnitude lower than previously reported, providing conditions
	more favorable for sustained {RF} emission. Second, the composition
	of impact plasmas from glass targets, unlike that of impact plasmas
	from tungsten, has low dependence on impact speed, indicating a charge
	production mechanism that is significant down to orbital debris speeds.
	Finally, negative ion formation has a strong dependence on target
	material. These new results can inform the design and operation of
	spacecraft in order to mitigate future impact-related space weather
	anomalies and failures.},

	observations with high power, large aperture ({HPLA}) radars, include
	the frequency and latitude dependency of the observed meteor altitude,
	speed, and deceleration distributions. We address these issues via
	the first ever use and analysis of meteor observations from the Poker
	Flat {AMISR} ({PFISR}: 449.3 {MHz}), Sondrestrom ({SRF}: 1,290 {MHz}),
	and Arecibo ({AO}: 430 {MHz}) radars. The {PFISR} and {SRF} radars
	are located near the Arctic Circle while {AO} is in the tropics.
	The meteors observed at each radar were detected and analyzed using
	the same automated {FFT} periodic micrometeor searching algorithm.
	Meteor parameters (event altitude, velocity, and deceleration distributions)
	from all three facilities are compared revealing a clearly defined
	altitude “ceiling effect” in the 1,290 {MHz} results relative to
	the 430/449.3 {MHz} results. This effect is even more striking in
	that the Arecibo and {PFISR} distributions are similar even though
	the two radars are over 2,000 times different in sensitivity and
	at very different latitudes, thus providing the first statistical
	evidence that {HPLA} meteor radar observations are dominated by the
	incident wavelength, regardless of the other radar parameters. We
	also offer insights into the meteoroid fragmentation and “terminal”
	process.},

	Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent
	of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis
	functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output
	function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations

  abstract = {Abstract– Meteorites have traditionally been defined as solid objects
	that have fallen to Earth from space. This definition, however, is
	no longer adequate. In recent decades, man-made objects have fallen
	to Earth from space, meteorites have been identified on the Moon
	and Mars, and small interplanetary objects have impacted orbiting
	spacecraft. Taking these facts and other potential complications
	into consideration, we offer new comprehensive definitions of the
	terms “meteorite,”“meteoroid,” and their smaller counterparts: A
	meteoroid is a 10-μm to 1-m-size natural solid object moving in interplanetary
	space. A micrometeoroid is a meteoroid 10 μm to 2 mm in size. A meteorite
	is a natural, solid object larger than 10 μm in size, derived from
	a celestial body, that was transported by natural means from the
	body on which it formed to a region outside the dominant gravitational
	influence of that body and that later collided with a natural or
	artificial body larger than itself (even if it is the same body from
	which it was launched). Weathering and other secondary processes
	do not affect an object’s status as a meteorite as long as something
	recognizable remains of its original minerals or structure. An object
	loses its status as a meteorite if it is incorporated into a larger
	rock that becomes a meteorite itself. A micrometeorite is a meteorite
	between 10 μm and 2 mm in size. Meteorite– “a solid substance or
	body falling from the high regions of the atmosphere” (Craig 1849);
	“[a] mass of stone and iron that ha[s] been directly observed to
	have fallen down to the Earth’s surface” (translated from Cohen 1894);
	“[a] solid bod[y] which came to the earth from space” (Farrington
	1915); “A mass of solid matter, too small to be considered an asteroid;
	either traveling through space as an unattached unit, or having landed
	on the earth and still retaining its identity” (Nininger 1933); “[a
	meteoroid] which has reached the surface of the Earth without being
	vaporized” (1958 International Astronomical Union ({IAU}) definition,
	quoted by Millman 1961); “a solid body which has arrived on the Earth
	from outer space” (Mason 1962); “[a] solid bod[y] which reach[es]
	the Earth (or the Moon, Mars, etc.) from interplanetary space and
	[is] large enough to survive passage through the Earth’s (or Mars’,
	etc.) atmosphere” (Gomes and Keil 1980); “[a meteoroid] that survive[s]

	“a recovered fragment of a meteoroid that has survived transit through
	the earth’s atmosphere” ({McSween} 1987); “[a] solid bod[y] of extraterrestrial

	In the original versions of {FISTA} and {FALM} the prox parameter

	The theoretical implications of using full backtracking in the framework
	of accelerated first-order and alternating linearization methods
	allows for better complexity estimates that depend on the ``average''
	prox parameter value. Moreover, we show that in the case of compressed

	used in incoherent scatter radar transmissions to obtain ambiguity-free
	measurements of autocorrelation functions or spectra with good range
	resolution. An alternating code set consists of several codes; typically,
	each successive radar pulse is modulated with a different code in
	the sequence. This technique is useful in other types of radar transmissions
	when the target is overspread, assuming the targets have certain
	statistical properties. Code sets for a new type of alternating code
	are presented for code lengths 8–12. This new type of alternating
	code differs from the first kind in two ways: it is subject to a
	slightly different condition for the elimination of ambiguity, and
	it is not restricted to lengths that are powers of 2. The new lengths
	are useful because they allow greater freedom in designing a multipurpose
	radar waveform best utilizing the available duty cycle of the radar.
	The alternating code technique is described in detail sufficient
	to allow an understanding of the two types and to show that the new
	condition for ambiguity-free measurements is a useful one. A search
	program was used to find the new sets; the aspects of the program
	important for decreasing the size of the search space are described.
	The code sets are presented, and their significance and uses are

  abstract = {Binary phase modulation using Barker codes as the modulating sequences
	is often used as a pulse compression technique in incoherent scatter
	radar measurements of the ionospheric E region. Demodulation of the
	compressed signal is usually accomplished by matched filtering techniques.
	If the target has appreciable velocity, the resulting Doppler shift
	detunes the scattered signal relative to the filter, and the target
	response spreads over a large range interval. The paper describes
	the development of a new data analysis method, based on an ambiguity
	function description of radar total-power measurements, which uses
	the characteristic Doppler decompression signatures to identify,
	extract, and analyze high-velocity events from conventional Barker-coded
	power profile type incoherent scatter ({IS}) measurements. Data sets
	recorded with the European Incoherent Scatter {UHF} (931 {MHz}) and
	{VHF} (224 {MHz}) radars during the 1990-1991 Geminid and 1993 Perseid
	showers are shown to contain many events which are associated with
	individual meteors crossing the radar beams over a wide range of
	aspect angles, including a few near-radial cases. Line-of-sight velocities
	and effective cross sections are derived for some of the best dual
	radar events. The cross sections are very small and increase with
	decreasing wavelength, something not observed before. It is suggested
	that this is indicative of a scattering mechanism different from
	the one operating at near-normal incidence at {VHF}, and Rayleigh
	scatter from compact “balls” of plasma contained within the meteor
	coma is proposed as a possible candidate, in qualitative agreement
	with the observations. Finally, some signal-processing related aspects
	of the method are discussed. It is shown that most {IS} radars should
	be able to apply it to their existing programs with very little effort
	and without having to compromise the performance in normal E region
	applications. The method could therefore become a powerful tool for
	studies of meteor statistics at {UHF} frequencies.},
